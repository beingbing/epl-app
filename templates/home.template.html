            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p class="lead">This page contains my final project of Level 4, which was to create a responsive SPA to display the match stats of EPL for year 2015-16 and 2016-17, it contains a list view of all the matches whose data is provided to me in JSON format, it has following views :</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled list-group" >
              <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">A view to display all matches held. This view contains various filters like filter by year, filter by Team name, filter by score etc.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">A view to display details of a single match.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">A view to display team wise statistics like total matches played, total won, total lost, total number of goals scored by that team etc.</li>
            </ul>
